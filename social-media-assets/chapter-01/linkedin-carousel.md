## Slide 3: What is System Design?

**Visual**: Building/architecture analogy

**Text**:
```
📐 SYSTEM DESIGN =

Building the blueprint for
software that scales.

Just like architects design buildings,
we design systems to handle:

• Millions of users
• Petabytes of data  
• 99.99% uptime
```

TWO TYPES OF SYSTEM DESIGN

┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
│     HLD     │  │     LLD     │
│─────────────│  │─────────────│
│ WHAT/WHERE  │  │    HOW      │
│ Components  │  │   Classes   │
│ Data flow   │  │   Methods   │
│ APIs        │  │   Code      │
└─────────────┘  └─────────────┘

## Slide 5: The Evolution

**Visual**: Stacked boxes showing progression

**Text**:
```
HOW SYSTEMS EVOLVE 📈

1️⃣ Single Server (100 users)
        ↓
2️⃣ Separate DB (10K users)
        ↓
3️⃣ Add Cache (100K users)
        ↓
4️⃣ Load Balancer (1M users)
        ↓
5️⃣ Database Sharding (10M+ users)
```

## Slide 6: The Building Blocks

**Visual**: Icons for each component

**Text**:
```
🧱 THE BUILDING BLOCKS

Every large system uses:

🌐 DNS & CDN
⚖️ Load Balancers
🖥️ Application Servers
💾 Databases
⚡ Caches (Redis)
📬 Message Queues
📦 Object Storage
```
